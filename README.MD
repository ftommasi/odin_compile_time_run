** THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT TO DO SOME TYPE OF METAPROGRAM WITHOUT REQUIRING COMPILER CHANGES **

Bill has said in the past that he does not support the idea of CTE as part of the programming language.
The spirit behind this project is to explore a prototype of doing some CTE similar to Jon Blow's language.

Ideally, the best way to do this would be to bake it into the compiler itself -- and that is probably an effort worth exploring. 
For the scope of this proof-of-concept, we will stick to making no changes to the compiler itself or requiring any other dependencies other than 
Odin itself and all the code in this package
